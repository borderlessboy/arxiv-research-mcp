# Code Cleanup Summary

This document summarizes the unused features that were removed from the arXiv Research MCP codebase to improve code clarity and reduce maintenance burden.

## Removed Features

### 1. RelevanceRanker Service (`src/services/relevance_ranker.py`)
- **Removed**: `get_feature_importance()` method
- **Reason**: Debug/analysis method that was never called
- **Impact**: No functional impact, removed unused debugging capability

### 2. CacheManager Service (`src/services/cache_manager.py`)
- **Removed**: `cleanup_expired_cache()` method
- **Reason**: Method was implemented but never called. Cache expiration is handled automatically when reading cache entries
- **Impact**: No functional impact, cache cleanup still works through automatic expiration

### 3. Date Utils (`src/utils/date_utils.py`)
- **Removed**: `format_date_for_display()` function
- **Reason**: Function was implemented but never used anywhere in the codebase
- **Impact**: No functional impact, date formatting is handled elsewhere

### 4. Text Utils (`src/utils/text_utils.py`)
- **Removed**: `clean_abstract()` function
- **Removed**: `extract_keywords()` function  
- **Removed**: `extract_citations()` function
- **Reason**: These text processing functions were implemented but never used
- **Impact**: No functional impact, text processing is handled by other methods

### 5. Paper Models (`src/models/paper.py`)
- **Removed**: `Author` class
- **Reason**: Model was defined but never used. The code uses simple string lists for authors instead
- **Impact**: No functional impact, author handling remains unchanged

## Preserved Features

The following core functionality was preserved and continues to work:

### RelevanceRanker
- ✅ `rank_papers()` - Main ranking functionality
- ✅ `select_top_papers()` - Paper selection
- ✅ `_prepare_paper_texts()` - Text preparation
- ✅ `_clean_text()` - Text cleaning

### CacheManager
- ✅ `get_cached_results()` - Cache retrieval
- ✅ `cache_results()` - Cache storage
- ✅ `clear_cache()` - Cache clearing
- ✅ `get_cache_stats()` - Cache statistics
- ✅ `_generate_cache_key()` - Key generation

### Date Utils
- ✅ `parse_arxiv_date()` - Date parsing
- ✅ `is_recent_paper()` - Date filtering

### Text Utils
- ✅ `truncate_text()` - Text truncation
- ✅ `format_author_list()` - Author formatting

### Paper Models
- ✅ `Paper` - Main paper model
- ✅ `SearchRequest` - Search request model
- ✅ `SearchResponse` - Search response model

## Benefits of Cleanup

1. **Reduced Code Complexity**: Removed 6 unused functions/methods
2. **Better Code Clarity**: Easier to understand what's actually being used
3. **Faster Development**: Less code to navigate and maintain
4. **Smaller Package Size**: Reduced file sizes and dependencies
5. **Improved Maintainability**: Fewer unused features to track

## Testing

All core imports were tested and confirmed working:
- ✅ RelevanceRanker imports successfully
- ✅ Date utils imports successfully  
- ✅ Text utils imports successfully
- ✅ Paper models import successfully

The cleanup was successful and maintains full functionality while removing unused code.
